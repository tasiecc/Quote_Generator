Fantastic work, Chidi! Your project exhibits a high level of craftsmanship, and the unique styling choices you've made add a refreshing touch to the user experience.

I appreciate your approach of ensuring that the getRandomQuote function returns the complete quote object, and your incorporation of extra features is commendable. I've included a hint in the individual rubric in case you'd like to explore creating a randomizer that avoids repeating quotes.

With your adeptness in this project, you're well-prepared to venture into more advanced JavaScript concepts in your next project. Enjoy the journey!
